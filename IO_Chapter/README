Tests for IO

1.  First compare against Brieman on small datasets using the same settings.
We expect to show that error bars are the same.  Use iris,breast cancer, and chess 
================================================

2.  Do speed comparison on three datasets against Ranger and XGBoost:.
I expect to be faster in most situations, and competitive otherwise.

================================================
3.  The motivation for a fast RerF is to increase p to 2d.  This isn't feasible for many datasets.  But We can show how training time increases with p.
I expect it to be linear.

================================================
4.  Do scale-up comparisons against Ranger and XGBoost.
I expect to scale better.

5.  Surely you had to use more memory to make this gain.
Show max memory used by each algorithm.
I expect to be lower.

6.  Now for the cheating method.  Show how cheating effects training time on data sets.
I expect the bin to work much faster.  Particularly on large N datasets.

7.  Great.  Its faster.  But what about accuracy on our three datasets?
Show accuracy as bin size decreases from 100% of N down to 5% of N.
Hopefully this shows only a slight decrease in accuracy.

8.  Does this help us use a higher p for increased accuracy?
It might.  Show linear speed up with increased p.
